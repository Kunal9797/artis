# Product Deletion Safeguards

This document describes the safeguards implemented to prevent accidental product deletion.

## Implemented Safeguards

### 1. Soft Delete (Paranoid Mode)
- Products are now soft-deleted by default
- Deleted products have `deletedAt`, `deletedBy`, and `deletionReason` fields
- Products can be recovered using the recovery endpoint
- Sequelize paranoid mode ensures deleted products are excluded from normal queries

### 2. Transaction Check
- Before deleting a product, the system checks if it has any transactions
- If transactions exist, deletion is blocked unless `force: true` is specified
- User receives a warning with the transaction count

### 3. Audit Logging
- All product deletions are logged in the `AuditLogs` table
- Logs include: who deleted, when, why, IP address, and full product data
- Recovery actions are also logged

### 4. Bulk Delete Disabled
- The dangerous "Delete All Products" endpoint is now disabled
- Returns a 403 error with explanation
- Original code is commented out but not removed

### 5. Recovery Mechanism
- New endpoints added:
  - `GET /api/products/deleted` - List all soft-deleted products
  - `POST /api/products/recover/:id` - Recover a deleted product
- Only admins can access these endpoints

## API Changes

### Delete Product
**Endpoint:** `DELETE /api/products/:id`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "force": false,  // Set to true to force delete even with transactions
  "reason": "Duplicate product entry"  // Optional deletion reason
}
```

**Response (if product has transactions):**
```json
{
  "error": "Product has existing transactions",
  "transactionCount": 42,
  "message": "This product has transaction history. Use force=true to delete anyway."
}
```

### List Deleted Products
**Endpoint:** `GET /api/products/deleted`
- Returns all soft-deleted products with deletion metadata

### Recover Product
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/products/recover/:id`
- Recovers a soft-deleted product
- Removes deletion metadata
- Creates audit log entry

## Database Changes

### Products Table
Added columns:
- `deletedAt` (TIMESTAMP) - When the product was deleted
- `deletedBy` (VARCHAR) - Username of who deleted it
- `deletionReason` (VARCHAR) - Why it was deleted

### AuditLogs Table
New table for tracking all deletion and recovery actions:
- `id` (UUID)
- `action` (VARCHAR) - DELETE, RECOVER, etc.
- `entityType` (VARCHAR) - Product, Transaction, etc.
- `entityId` (VARCHAR) - ID of the deleted entity
- `entityData` (JSONB) - Snapshot of the entity data
- `userId` (UUID)
- `userName` (VARCHAR)
- `userRole` (VARCHAR)
- `reason` (TEXT)
- `ipAddress` (VARCHAR)
- `userAgent` (TEXT)
- `createdAt` (TIMESTAMP)

## Best Practices

1. **Always provide a reason** when deleting products
2. **Check for transactions** before forcing deletion
3. **Review deleted products** periodically
4. **Use recovery** instead of recreating products
5. **Monitor audit logs** for unusual deletion patterns

## Future Enhancements

1. Add email notifications for product deletions
2. Implement a "trash bin" UI for managing deleted products
3. Add scheduled permanent deletion after X days
4. Implement role-based deletion permissions
5. Add bulk recovery functionality
